This directory contains tasks from the "0x02. C - Functions, nested loops" project.
The files are mostly C source code files, alongside one header file "main.h" that contains all the function prototypes.
Some of the restrictions in this project were:
[x] There was no use of the sstandard library
[x] No use of functions like printf() and puts()


main.h
This is a header file that has all function prototypes as well as the prototype of the function "_putchar"(_).

0-putchar.c
Task 0
This program prints "_putchar"(_) followed by a new line.

1-alphabet.c
Task 1
This program contains a function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

2-print_alphabet_x10
Task 2
This program contains a function that prints 10 rows of the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

3-islower.c
Task 3
This program contains a function that checks for the lowercase character. It returns 1 if the character is lowercase and 0 if otherwise.

4-isalpha.c
Task 4
This program contains a function that checks for an alphabetic character. It returns 1 if the character is a letter - lowercase or uppercase - and 0 otherwise.

5-sign.c
Task 5
This program contains a function that prints the sign of a number; '+' if it is greater thn 0, '0' if it is 0 and '-' if it is less than 0.

6-abs.c
Task 6
This program contains a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
