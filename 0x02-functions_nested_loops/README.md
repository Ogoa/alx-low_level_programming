This directory contains tasks from the "0x02. C - Functions, nested loops" project.
The files are mostly C source code files, alongside one header file "main.h" that contains all the function prototypes.
Some of the restrictions in this project were:
[x] There was no use of the sstandard library
[x] No use of functions like printf() and puts()


main.h
This is a header file that has all function prototypes as well as the prototype of the function "_putchar"(_).

0-putchar.c
Task 0
This program prints "_putchar"(_) followed by a new line.

1-alphabet.c
Task 0
