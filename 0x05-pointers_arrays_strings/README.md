This directory contains tasks from the "0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings" project.
The files are mostly C source code files, alongside one header file "main.h" that contains all the function prototypes.
Some of the restrictions in this project were:
[x] There was no use of the sstandard library
[x] No use of functions like printf() and puts()


main.h
This header file contains all the function prototypes of function used in the various programs.

0 -reset_to_98.c
Task 0
This program contains a function that takes a pointer to an integer and updates the value it points to, to 98.

1-swap.c
Task 1
This program contains a function that swaps takes two arguments passed by reference and swaps their values.

2-strlen.c
Task 2
This program contains a function that returns the length of a string.

3-puts.c
Task 3
This program contains a function that prints a string followed by a new line to stdout.

4-print_rev.c
Task 4
This program contains a function that prints a string in reversee, followed by a new line.

5-rev_string.c
Task 5
This program contains a function that reverses a string.

6-puts2.c
Task 6
This program contains a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7-puts_half
Task 7
This program contains a function that prints half a string, followed by a new line.
Only the second half of the string is printed.
If the number of characters is odd, the last 'n' charachters of the string should be printed, where "n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2".
