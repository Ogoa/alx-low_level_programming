This directory contains tasks from the "0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings" project.
The files are mostly C source code files, alongside one header file "main.h" that contains all the function prototypes.
Some of the restrictions in this project were:
[x] There was no use of the sstandard library
[x] No use of functions like printf() and puts()


main.h
This is a header file that contains all the function prototypes of functions that have been used across the different programs in this directory.

0-strcat.c
Task 0
This program contains a function that concatenates two strings.
The function appends the 'src' string to the 'dest' string,  overwriting the terminating null byte at the end of 'dest', and then adds a terminating null byte.

1-strncat.c
Task 1
This program contains a function that concatenates two strings, similar to strcat. However, only 'n' bytes from 'src' are used.

2-strncpy.c
Task 2
This program contains a function that copies a string.
The function works exactly like the "strncpy" function in the string library.

3-strcmp.c
Task 3
This program contains a function that compares two strings.
It works exactly like "strcmp" found in the C "string" library.
