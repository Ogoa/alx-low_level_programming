This directory contains tasks from the "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops" project.
The files are mostly C source code files, alongside one header file "main.h" that contains all the function prototypes.
Some of the restrictions in this project were:
[x] There was no use of the sstandard library
[x] No use of functions like printf() and puts()


main.h
This is a header file that contains all the function prototypes that are used across various programs in this project.

0-isupper.c
Task 0
This program contains a function that checks for an uppercase character and returns 1 if true and 0 if otherwise.

1-isdigit.c
Task 1
This program contains a function that checks for a digit(0 through 9) and returns 1 if the given number is a digit, otherwise it returns 0;

2-mul.c
Task 2
This program contains a function that multiplies two given integers and returns the result.

3-print_numbers.c
Task 3
This program contains a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c
Task 4
This program contains a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9 with an exception of 2 and 4, followed by a new line.

5-more_numbers.c
Task 5
This program contains a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14,on ten lines. 
"_putchar()"_ can only be used three times.

6-print_line.c
Task 6
This program contains a function that draws a straight line by printing '_' (_) 'n' number of times.
The line should end with a new line character. If 'n' is 0 or less, only a new line character.

7-print_diagonal.c
Task 7
This program contains a function that draws a diagonal line by printing '\' a given number of times.
If 'n' is 0 or less, the functions should only print '\n'.

8-print_square.c
Task 8
This program contains a function that prints a square of size 'n', using the character '#'.
If 'n' is 0 or less only a new line should be printed.
Only _putchar() is used.(_)
