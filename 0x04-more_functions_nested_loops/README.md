This directory contains tasks from the "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops" project.
The files are mostly C source code files, alongside one header file "main.h" that contains all the function prototypes.
Some of the restrictions in this project were:
[x] There was no use of the sstandard library
[x] No use of functions like printf() and puts()


main.h
