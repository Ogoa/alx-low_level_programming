This directory contains tasks under the `0x14. C - Bit manipulation` project.<br>
It contains C source files as well as a single header file<br>
- The only C standard library functions used are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`.
- No more than five functions per file


`main.h`<br>
This header file contains funciton prototypes of all the functions used across the various source files in this directory.

`0-binary_to_uint.c`<br>
Task 0<br>
This program contains a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`. The binary number is passed in as a string.

`1-print_binary.c`<br>
Task 1<br>
This program contains a function that prints the binary representaion of a number. The use of arrays, `malloc` and `%` and `/` operators was not allowed in this case.

`2-get_bit.c`<br>
