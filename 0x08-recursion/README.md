This directory contains tasks from the "0x08. C - Recursion" project.
The files are mostly C source code files, alongside one header file "main.h" that contains all the function prototypes.
Some of the restrictions in this project were:
[x] There was no use of the sstandard library
[x] No use of functions like printf() and puts()
[x] No use of loops


main.h
This is a header file that contains all the function prototypes of functions that have been used across the different programs in this directory.

0-puts_recursion.c
Task 0
This program contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. It worsk in a similar way to the puts() function provided in the standard library.

1-printf_rev_recursion.c
Task 1
This program contains a function that prints a string in reverse.

2-strlen_recursion.c
Task 2
This program contains a function that returns the length of a string. It works in a similar way to the strlen() function provided in the standard library.

3-factorial.c
Task 3
This program contains a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

4-pow_recursion.c
Task 4
This program contains a function that returns the value of 'x' raised to the power of 'y'.

5-sqrt_recursion.c
Task 5
This program contains a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
If the number does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.
The function works in a similar way to the sqrt() function provided by the standard library.
