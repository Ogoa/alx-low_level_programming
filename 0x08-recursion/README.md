This directory contains tasks from the "0x08. C - Recursion" project.
The files are mostly C source code files, alongside one header file "main.h" that contains all the function prototypes.
Some of the restrictions in this project were:
[x] There was no use of the sstandard library
[x] No use of functions like printf() and puts()
[x] No use of loops


main.h
This is a header file that contains all the function prototypes of functions that have been used across the different programs in this directory.

0-puts_recursion.c
Task 0
